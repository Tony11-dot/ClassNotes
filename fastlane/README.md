# Available Actions

## iOS

### ios fix_signing

```

Bump build number (from TestFlight), build, and upload to TestFlight.

### ios latest

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane ios latest
```

Print the latest build number TestFlight has for ClassNotes — the post-ship verification (read-only, uploads nothing).

### ios upload
